# Amazon-meta-Social-Network-Analysis
Project for the course Social network analysis.

To start we need to pre-process the Amazon.meta.txt file, and the preprocessing is done in the two files: BookDfCreation.py and ReviewDfCreation.py\n
Now we can create the two graph, using the two python file: BookCopurchasingNetworkCreation.py and BookReviewNetworkCreation.py/n
We can analyse the two graph using the measures given by the networkx library, as done in the two final files: BookCopurchasingAnalysis.py and BookReviewAnalysis.py
